EXPERTISE LEVEL: I did python a while ago when I was younger and did just a bit of QBasic in high school, however I have had no experience with coding since, so I would say beginner.


01.DRAWING ('01.DRAWING/index.html')
For the drawing prompt, I wanted to depict the split people feel when it concerns the concept of owning billions of a currency - the dual feeling of being against it and wishing one was in that position. It took me a while and a lot of tweaking to get the positioning of the shapes; I originally had a triangle in the drawing, but I struggled with the values. I especially struggled with getting a vertical line and struggled to find a simple way to accomplish it.
