EXPERTISE LEVEL: I did python a while ago when I was younger and did just a bit of QBasic in high school, however I have had no experience with coding since, so I would say beginner.

03.MULTIPLES ('03.MULTIPLES/index.html')
For the multiples prompt, I was inspired by asterism, a bright or thick pattern of stars in the sky. I figured out how to implement the emojis and display them at a particular rate pretty quickly; What I struggled with was getting them to co-exist with the circles' code, and to get both to display at the same time. It took a lot of research to figure out what was wrong with how I formatted my code. However, I was able to implement the mouseClicked function with more ease.
