EXPERTISE LEVEL: I did python a while ago when I was younger and did just a bit of QBasic in high school, however I have had no experience with coding since, so I would say beginner.


01.DRAWING ('01.DRAWING/index.html')
For the drawing prompt, I wanted to depict the split people feel when it concerns the concept of owning billions of a currency - the dual feeling of being against it and wishing one was in that position. It took me a while and a lot of tweaking to get the positioning of the shapes; I originally had a triangle in the drawing, but I struggled with the values. I especially struggled with getting a vertical line and struggled to find a simple way to accomplish it.

02.MOVEMENT ('02.MOVEMENT/index.html')
For the movement prompt, I wanted to digitally recreate the process of a pour painting, where you stack different colours of paint and simply pour over the canvas. As I have done this before, I used colours similar to those in my painting. I tweaked the rotation functions a lot to get them in specific positions. I found it difficult to understand them. Once again, I struggled with the values on the triangles and changing their position proved really difficult. I along the line made the mistake of having the canvas set to window height and window width, and then in my code confining the shapes to move within points that ended at 500; It took me quite some time to discover and understand the mistake. However I was able to fix this and get the desired effect. I had originally intended to layer text over it, however I found this to be really complicated when the 'WEBGL' function is in use, and hence did ot include it.

03.MULTIPLES ('03.MULTIPLES/index.html')
For the multiples prompt, I was inspired by asterism, a bright or thick pattern of stars in the sky. I figured out how to implement the emojis and display them at a particular rate pretty quickly; What I struggled with was getting them to co-exist with the circles' code, and to get both to display at the same time. It took a lot of research to figure out what was wrong with how I formatted my code. However, I was able to implement the mouseClicked function with more ease.

04.MEDIA ('04.MEDIA/index.html')
For the media prompt, I decided to display images of protests that took place in 2020 in my country, Nigeria, following the unjust killing of NIgerian youths by military personel and government officials at a toll gate during a peaceful protest on the 20th of October 2020. The audio added is the song '20 10 20' by Burno Boy, which tells this story and expresses disappointment and anger towards the government for the situation. This prompt I found a lot easier then the others in terms of the process and how to write the code. My only obstacles were figuring out how to include multiple images and how to get the audio to pause when the screen is clicked.
