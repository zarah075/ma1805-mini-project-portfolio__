EXPERTISE LEVEL: I did python a while ago when I was younger and did just a bit of QBasic in high school, however I have had no experience with coding since, so I would say beginner.

04.MEDIA ('04.MEDIA/index.html')
For the media prompt, I decided to display images of protests that took place in 2020 in my country, Nigeria, following the unjust killing of NIgerian youths by military personel and government officials at a toll gate during a peaceful protest on the 20th of October 2020. The audio added is the song '20 10 20' by Burno Boy, which tells this story and expresses disappointment and anger towards the government for the situation. This prompt I found a lot easier then the others in terms of the process and how to write the code. My only obstacles were figuring out how to include multiple images and how to get the audio to pause when the screen is clicked.
